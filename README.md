NumFOCUS has a Board of Directors (composed of an Administrative Board and a Technical Steering Committee) who provide guidance, oversight, and support for various NumFOCUS-led initiatives. [^1]
Members of these groups have fixed term limits.
As members complete their term or step-down, new members need to be elected to the board.
Historically, there has not been a formal process for recruiting and admitting new board members.

A [volunteer-led Election Committee](election-committee.md) has been formed to plan and execute elections for the Board of Directors and Technical Steering Committee in a fair, unbiased, and transparent manner.
