# NumFOCUS Board Elections

NumFOCUS has a Board of Directors who provide guidance, oversight, and support for various NumFOCUS-led initiatives. [^1]
Board members have fixed term limits. As members complete their term or step-down, new members need to be elected to the board. Historically, there has not been a formal process for recruiting and admitting new board members.

A [volunteer-led Election Committee](election-committee.md) has been formed to plan and execute board elections in a fair, unbiased, and transparent manner.

_If you are interested in **joining the election committee** and have at least 2 hours/week to dedicate to this effort for a few months, please reach out to any of the committee members. Note that all community members can share feedback and thoughts on the activities. The committee is responsible for executing the election, which requires some steady time commitment._
