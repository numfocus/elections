## **Abby Tse**
**Affiliations:** PyData NYC Meetup since 2022, PyData NYC Conference Chair 2023–2024, PyData Boston Conference Chair 2025, Women in Data Science NYC Conference Guest Speaker 2023–2025, INROADS mentor 2020–present

Open science has shaped my career and community. I’ve seen how access, transparency, and collaboration can change the trajectory of someone’s work—and that’s what drives me to contribute to NumFOCUS. Since 2023, I’ve led the PyData NYC Meetup, helping the community grow from 5,000 to over 8,000 members by creating spaces where people can learn, share, and connect. I also serve as the Northeast U.S. representative on the PyData Strategic Committee, helping coordinate regional strategy and support local chapters.

Every year, I organize the PyData NYC/Boston Conference, welcoming over 600 people from around the world to celebrate open-source innovation. I use the event to highlight what I love most about open science—people sharing their work openly, learning from one another, and inspiring new connections across disciplines.

At IBM, I’m a Software Engineer focused on developing generative AI solutions that improve collaboration and productivity across the organization. I also work to bridge gaps between industry and open-source communities, fostering partnerships like the AI Alliance and encouraging collaboration between IBM teams and PyData contributors.

I’m running for the NumFOCUS Board to help connect people and ideas—linking open-source communities, industry partners, and researchers to create lasting impact together.

## **Adam Hill**
**Affiliations:** ComplyAdvantage, PyData Southampton, PyData London conference, DataKind UK, University of Southampton

My dedication to the open-source scientific community is foundational to my career. It began with 10 years as a research astrophysicist and was solidified during my three years as a Royal Society Entrepreneur in Residence. In that institutional role, I worked to bridge the gap between academia and industry, and my contribution to the Dynamics of Data Science Skills report reinforced my belief that open tools are critical for an empowered society.

This belief is what drew me to the PyData community 10 years ago. The welcome and free exchange of ideas I found there were essential to my transition from academia. It drove me to give back, progressing from an attendee to a speaker, then founding the PyData Southampton chapter, and now serving as a co-organiser for the PyData London conference.

My motivation for joining the board is simple: I want to serve the community that has been essential to my own success and ensure it continues to thrive for the next generation.

I bring concrete operational and oversight experience to this role. As an Interim Director of Data Science, I managed departmental recruitment and rebuilt a corporate team. As a DataKind UK Communities Committee member, I oversaw project staffing, process improvement, and volunteer strategy. This unique blend of institutional, commercial, and nonprofit leadership has prepared me to contribute effectively to the NumFOCUS board.

## **Alejandro Saucedo**
**Affiliations:** Director, Zalando SE; Chief Scientist, The Institute for Ethical AI; Board Member, ACM; AI Expert, United Nations

Hello, my name is Alejandro, I live in Berlin, and work at the European tech company Zalando SE, where I lead an Engineering & Science organisation that builds the Pricing, Forecasting & Marketing Intelligence for 50m customers. I have been an active member of the NumFOCUS community throughout (almost) the past decade; this has included collaborations such as published case studies as well as many PyData talks and keynotes.

I am excited for this opportunity to contribute to NumFOCUS further. I bring extensive experience in Responsible AI, having founded the Institute for Ethical AI in 2017 and having led major industry and research initiatives, including contributions to European policy (EU AI Act, DSA, Data Act). I have also served in board and advisory roles at the ACM, European Commission, United Nations, and Linux Foundation.

On a more personal side, I live with my partner and our 18-month-old. Besides attending PyData events, I enjoy contributing to OSS, and I currently maintain the C++ GPU compute library “Vulkan Kompute”.

## **Dawn Wages**
**Affiliations:** Python Software Foundation, DjangoCon US, DjangoCon Africa, Organization for Ethical Source, Djangonaut Space, WagtailCMS Core Team

I'm new to the NumFOCUS/scientific computing ecosystem, but not to open source or Python. Where NumFOCUS is headed, new people who are kind, direct, thoughtful, and willing to roll up their sleeves will be key to its next chapter.

I plan to spend my first few years sharing what I’ve learned from the Django and Python ecosystems and learning more about NumFOCUS. If things go well, I’ll run again with more context and a track record of success. Being new won’t make me shy about presenting good ideas, but I don’t anticipate pushing big changes that haven’t been vetted. The most important tasks seem obvious: sponsor engagement, fiscal sponsor support, professionalization of foundation staff activities, and audience communication. I look forward to helping with these.

## **Francesca van Doorn**
**Affiliations:** Windward Fund, National Network of Fiscal Sponsors

While my work in conservation and the environment is adjacent to NumFOCUS’ mission, the foundation of the organization—supporting open-source software to drive impact and innovation—is crucial to progress across fields. Solving the climate crisis requires transparency, collaboration across sectors, and replicability and scalability, all of which are core tenets of open source.

I would welcome the opportunity to support an Austin-based fiscal sponsor whose work aligns so closely with my mission and values. I bring a strong financial background and am currently Director of Finance and Operations for Windward Fund, an environmental fiscal sponsor. My experience spans financial operations, risk management, philanthropic investing, tax requirements, ethical issues in research, and strategic planning.

## **Habet Madoyan**
**Affiliations:** American University of Armenia

As the inaugural Program Chair of the B.S. in Data Science at the American University of Armenia and co-founder of Datamotus, I’ve seen firsthand how open source creates communities, especially in developing economies.

I founded and lead PyData Yerevan—the first PyData community in the region—organizing conferences and meetups that connect academia, industry, and open-source contributors.

I believe open source is not just a technological model but a development philosophy. Serving on the Board would allow me to represent perspectives from smaller countries where open source is often the only viable path to innovation.

I bring experience leading a 400-student university program, managing research projects, and overseeing strategy, budgeting, marketing, and community events. My goal is to strengthen NumFOCUS’s global reach and help transform small countries from open source users into open source contributors.

## **Henry Senyondo**
**Affiliations:** GSOC, Data Retriever

I am deeply committed to NumFOCUS and the open-source scientific community. For ten years, I have served as Google Summer of Code administrator for NumFOCUS and contributed to projects such as Data Retriever and DeepForest. I’ve reviewed for JOSS, contributed to rOpenSci, and served as a Carpentries trainer, promoting open workflows and reproducible research.

I am motivated to join the Administrative Board to help secure funding for key projects and identify emerging initiatives. I bring experience in research coordination, community leadership, grant collaboration, and organizational planning, supported by MBA training in strategic planning and governance. I am committed to collaborative, long-term success for the community.

## **James A. Bednar**
**Affiliations:** Anaconda, Inc.; HoloViz.org

I am honored to be nominated. During my academic career, I championed open source and taught students about its impact. Eventually I shifted my career to work full-time on open source at Anaconda, assembling millions of dollars in funding for the NumFOCUS-sponsored HoloViz project (Panel, HoloViews, Datashader, hvPlot, Param, Colorcet).

I hope to apply my experience at Anaconda and in academic leadership to further NumFOCUS’s mission. What NumFOCUS does matters, and it deserves careful stewardship and impassioned leadership.
