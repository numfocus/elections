## Corey J. Gallon |

PwC, Loyola University Chicago, GPT-Engineer |
I'm a massive nerd. Full stop. I've built my career at the intersection of technology and business, and am deeply nerdy in my pursuits in both domains. I'm a passionate data scientist, AI enthusiast and business leader. I find it a bit awkward and uncomfortable to speak about my credentials, but a few relevant details of the past several years are probably worth highlighting in this context.

I recently concluded my tenure serving as Vice Chairman and Director of the Board at OIX (formerly Open-IX), a not-for-profit organization and ANSI accredited standards organization whose mission is to standardize connectivity at Internet Exchanges and data centers. I was recruited to OIX to assist in expanding the strategic and technical missions of the organization. I'm proud of the work done by the excellent team there in the years that I was fortunate to contribute.

Presently, my full-time professional efforts are engaged as the leader of the Accelerators software product business at PwC. Since 2019, when we started the Products & Technology business, I've had the great pleasure of building an amazing team of technologists and product gurus with whom we've built some truly exciting and differentiating technology. With the mainstream availability of generative AI in 2022, I've been hands on in the technical leadership of our AI Studio which has been one of the most rewarding times of my professional career!

I have also been quite fortunate to be a founding faculty member of the Master’s in Business Data Analytics program at Loyola University Chicago, where I teach machine learning in Python. I'm presently enjoying a sabbatical, which frees up some time that I would love to contribute to NumFOCUS!

I'm an active open-source software community member. Last year I had the privilege of BENG invited to the core development team of the popular GPT-Engineer AI code generation project, and I enjoy the opportunity I have each week to work with other open-source machine learning and software engineers in the community.

I'm such a fan of NumFOCUS projects! I'm a longtime user of Pandas, Jupyter, Conda, Conda-Forge, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib ... NumFOCUS projects power so much of the Python data science ecosystem! (My rather minor contribution to this wonderful ecosystem, as of a few years back, is that I am the maintainer of the Python Spotipy package on Conda-Forge. Packaging and maintaining Spotify for Conda-Forge was born out of a machine learning project of mine to build a model which could predict the popularity of a song based on its musical attributes ... so fun!)

PyData is AMAZING! I've consumed countless hundreds of hours of brilliant conference talks and content over the years. In fact, I was lined up to speak at PyData Warsaw in 2017 but had to drop due to competing professional commitments. (I was midstream in my consulting career at the time, and the consulting lifestyle is so volatile. I'm pleased to have pivoted out of that demanding career back in 2019.) I remain eager to reprioritize time to share details of some of the projects I work on at upcoming PyData conferences.

On a more personal note, I love specialty coffee and geeking out with my laptop-powered Aillio Bullet in pursuit of perfecting the roasting of deliciously berry-forward notes of Ethiopian Yirgachefe coffee. I recently took delivery of over 20kgs of green Misty Valley Yirgachefe coffee beans to feed my roasting hobby for the balance of the summer months. With 4kgs roasted during my last roasting session, I'm enjoying a lovely pour over cup of this Ethiopian delight as I write!

I'm so very excited at the prospect of contributing to an organization that I have long admired! I appreciate your consideration and hope to have the opportunity to work together in this noble effort! |

## David R. Palmer |

LDP Memorial Scholarship Fund Inc (NON-PROFIT), Twenty-One Parcels Limitada, Palmer Asset Management LLC, and Harvester Capital Management LLC. |
My programming and technological business acumen dates back to the early 1990's. During that time I created an application used by floor traders on multiples trading floors, and helped design the first trading application for auto-quoting with Bridge Data on the floor of the American Stock Exchange. I have successfully run businesses since that time. Whether I was running my firm, which at its peak had one hundred employees in two countries and a programming dev team of five, or simply working by myself. Throughout all I have never turned my back on what one individual can do with a little time and some software. To this day I continue to program, python of course with machine learning, and have been the recipient of the largesse of open source and find myself desperately wanting to give back by giving of my time and experience. While I might be a good choice for the technical role, I am leaning towards the administrative for this round of nominations. Thank you for your time. |

## Francesca van Doorn |

Windward Fund, National Network of Fiscal Sponsors, Fiscal Sponsor Hub |
While my work in conservation and the environment is adjacent to NumFOCUS’ mission, the foundation of the organization, supporting open source software to drive impact and innovation, is crucial to progress across fields. Solving the climate crisis requires transparency; collaboration across sectors, geographies, and cultures; and replicability and scalability – all of which are core tenets of the open source community.

The nature of fiscal sponsorship offers unique operational challenges and opportunities:

- Fiscal sponsors are often more agile, meaning they can move both money and ideas in ways that more bureaucratic organizations often cannot;
- They are able to reach populations that large corporations and donors are often unaware even exist;
- They can foster community for mission-aligned groups and reduce administrative burdens, maximizing programmatic impact;
- They must carefully balance risk – the actions, decisions, and needs of individual projects can significantly impact the whole ecosystem; and
- They have a unique revenue model that can make investing in the organization’s growth challenging

The strategic planning work for the organization will need to play to these strengths and take into account potential challenges to ensure long-term success and sustainability for the organization. I would welcome the ability to actively participate in the success of a local Austin-based fellow fiscal sponsor, whose work is so crucial to my own mission and values.
I would bring significant experience with fiscal sponsors to the role. I have worked for or supported seven different fiscal sponsor organizations and partnered with half a dozen more on various initiatives. I have a strong financial background and am currently the Director of Finance and Operations for Windward Fund, an environment focused fiscal sponsor non-profit that supports conservation and environmental science projects. My experience across fiscal sponsor organizations includes:

- Financial Operations: overseeing comprehensive financial systems, ensuring fiscal integrity, and optimizing financial performance
- Risk Management: developing a risk framework and implementation plan to ensure compliance with local, state, and federal laws and regulations, as well as determine organizational exposure to non-legal risks.
- Grants Management for Fiscally Sponsored Projects: helping projects to secure and managing grant funding, ensuring compliance with donor requirements, and sourcing funding opportunities
- Management of Large Fiscal Sponsor Organizations: handling the complexities of organizations with over 100 projects, ensuring seamless operations and effective project oversight
- Philanthropic Investing: strategic investments that drive philanthropic goals and foster sustainable impact
- Tax Requirements for Nonprofits: tax regulations and compliance requirements for nonprofit organizations
- Legal Requirements for Nonprofits: legal frameworks governing nonprofit entities
- Ethical and Legal Concerns in Scientific Research: the ethical considerations and legal obligations pertinent to scientific projects
- Strategic Planning: developing and implementing strategic plans that align with organizational goals |

## James A. Bednar |

Anaconda, Inc., and HoloViz.org |
I'm deeply honored to have been nominated to serve on the NumFocus Board. I've been committed to open source for the past 35 years, originally as a grad student and professor, where I taught courses covering open source and ensured that all of our research code was made freely available. Only a few people ever actually used our academic code, but now that I and some of my former students are in industry and able to employ a whole team of developers, we've been able to develop and maintain powerful libraries at a much larger scale using corporate and government funding. The tools in the NumFocus-sponsored HoloViz project are now downloaded millions of times per month and used extensively across scientific and research areas and in both industry and universities. I hope to use my experience with running academic research centers and enterprise software development teams to further NumFocus's mission to benefit all of the users and developers of open source worldwide. |

## Jesica Formoso |

I am deeply committed to the open-source scientific community, actively participating as an organizer for the Buenos Aires chapter of R-Ladies. I also serve as Chair of the advisory board and Impact Measurement Coordinator at MetaDocencia, an organization focused on promoting Open Science in Latin America. In 2023, I contributed to the NumFOCUS DISC unconference, collaborating on a project to develop training for Latin American and African researchers on securing international funding, for which we are currently seeking funding, with plans for 2025.
Additionally, I develop open educational resources focused on reproducible workflows for satellite image analysis as part of a NASA-funded project through MetaDocencia and 2i2c.
My motivation to volunteer on the NumFOCUS Board stems from my belief in the organization's mission to promote open practices in research and data science. As a researcher in Latin America, I understand the challenges of adopting open science practices, which stem from cultural beliefs, institutional assessments, the time required to learn and implement these practices, and the reliance on volunteer or unpaid work. I also recognize their importance, not only for reproducibility and validation but also for democratizing access to information and increasing the representation of underrepresented communities in science. Open practices foster collaboration, which has the potential to overcome many of the technological and economic limitations we face in our region. |

Econ-ARK(Core Developer)
SciPy US [2024, 2023] (Maintainers track co-chair)
NumFOCUS Infrastructure committee (member)
NumFOCUS SDG committee (member) |
Over the past decade, NumFOCUS has achieved a great deal and it has been able to gain (and maintain) a critical mass in the wider scientific open source ecosystem. By serving on the administrative board, I would like to help sustain this momentum and secure a robust future for NumFOCUS and it's projects.

Over the past few years I have been involved with various parts of the NumFOCUS community:

- I have been volunteering on the SDG and infrastructure committee for the last couple of years. I also helped run the GSoC program for NumFOCUS projects from 2017 to 2023 (200 projects over 7 summers!).

- I have been contributing to NumFOCUS projects since 2015 and I'm in the core developer teams of NetworkX and Econ-ARK. I was also the co-PI on a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative EOSS grant that let me work on NetworkX for the last 2 years. I have also been involved with others community projects like Scientific Python and some small contributions all around the ecosystem. As part of my maintainer duties I have been lucky to mentor new folks (through programs like Outreachy, GSoC, internships) joining our communities.

- On the education and organization front I helped start the PyData Dubai meetup and we ran multiple events in 2023. I have moved away but I am happy that we were able to reach the momentum to keep the meetup running. I have also presented talks, tutorials, helped organised sprints, helped with reviewing proposals at multiple PyData and SciPy [US/Euro] conferences over the years.

Currently, I work at the European Spallation Source, focusing on scientific open source software for neutron science. We use lots of projects from the NumFOCUS community :)

I believe I can be a valuable addition to the administrative board and NumFOCUS can use our collective networks in the broader ecosystem to set strategic plans. I have experience with grant financials and if giving talks about why supporting the broader scientific OSS ecosystem/NumFOCUS is important counts as marketing, I have been doing that for some time too :)

By joining the administrative board, I aim to leverage my experience and passion to further strengthen NumFOCUS and its impact on the scientific open source community.

Plus I absolutely love reading legal and financial statements for fun (neither a lawyer or accountant!).

Please do feel free to reach out to me if folks have any questions!

fun fact: SymPy was my first-ever open source contribution! Can't believe it's been almost 10 years since I made that PR!! |

## Sayantika Banik |

PSF/DSF/PyLadies/R-Ladies/Data Visualisation Society/MIT/Indian School of business (ISB) |
I am a data scientist, dive professional, strategist, artist, public speaker, and community builder, deeply committed to the open-source scientific community. My work has consistently focused on improving lives and lowering entry barriers through technology and creative solutions.

Contributor to open-source libraries such as SciPy, NumPy, and Conbench. Love building scalable models and designing end-to-end solutions.
