# Election process

At a high-level, the elections will involve a nomination phase followed by voting.
This page documents the details and processes of these stages.

## Communication

The GitHub repository will host all election-related documentation for the community, including the processes, nomination/voting criteria, election results, committee workflows, etc.
The Election Committee will coordinate tasks through issues on the GitHub repos, where any community member can share feedback and request any additional information.

The committee will draft messages to communicate the call for nominations, voting periods, and more, to reach the broader community.

These messages will be published by NumFOCUS in the following spaces:

- Mailing lists
- Newsletter
- Social media
- NumFOCUS Slack
- Relevant community spaces like specific Discord/Discourse/Slack groups

## Nominations

### Solicit nominees

Anyone can nominate themselves or someone else to run for one of the board positions,
i.e., either the Administrative Board or the Technical Steering Committee, based on their experience and interest by filling a nomination form.

We welcome and encourage participation from people of all backgrounds, identities, and geographic diversity.

Nominees for the **Technical Steering Committee** should be contributors or members of a NumFOCUS Sponsored or Affiliated Project community.
They should have experience in areas such as governance or community leadership, budget creation and management, infrastructure, and strategic planning.

Nominees for the **Administrative Board** should be members of the NumFOCUS community with experience in one or more of the following areas: organizational or corporate finance, strategic planning, legal oversight, or marketing and sales.

### Review nominees

The current NumFOCUS Board will review and confirm nominees according to the following criteria:

- Eligibility per bylaw requirements and reasonable extensions, including:
  - Minimum legal age in the residing county: Underage individuals can be removed from the final list of nominees.
  - Term limits for previous Board members.
- Past actions must comply with NumFocusâ€™ Code of Conduct (CoC). Specifically:
  - If the nominated individual has/had a reported CoC violation, they can be removed from the nomination list by the Board depending on the severity of the report.
  - If the person nominating someone else has/had a reported CoC violation, the nominated individual (who does not any reports) can be asked to self-nominate instead.
- Plausible interest in NumFOCUS and the surrounding community
  - If the individual's qualifications and interests are unclear, Board can request further information to ensure the voting community has the relevant information.
    Board can not remove individuals from the final list for this reason.
- Election committee members running in the election:
  - Board can decide on whether election committee members can be in the final list of nominees.
    If yes, the committee will ensure the level of visibility for this member within the committee is the same as all other nominees.
    If no, the individual can choose between the election committee and being nominated in the election.

### Publish nominees

After screening, the election committee will publish the list of nominees and announce the beginning of the voting period.
