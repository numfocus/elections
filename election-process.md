# Election process

At a high-level, the elections will involve a nomination phase followed by voting.
This page documents the details and processes of these stages.

## Communication

The GitHub repository will host all election-related documentation for the community, including the processes, nomination/voting criteria, election results, committee workflows, etc.
The Election Committee will coordinate tasks through issues on the GitHub repos, where any community member can share feedback and request any additional information.

The committee will draft messages to communicate the call for nominations, voting periods, and more, to reach the broader community.

These messages will be published by NumFOCUS in the following spaces:

- Mailing lists
- Newsletter
- Social media
- NumFOCUS Slack
- Relevant community spaces like specific Discord/Discourse/Slack groups
